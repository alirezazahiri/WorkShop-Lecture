# `1.` `(windows only)`
- open `microsoft store` (or even `google`) and easily `search` for `python` and the first thing you see is the latest version of python to install on your computer
- run   `python get-pip.py`   on your command line 
- use   `pip install virtualenv`   to install virtual environment essentials
- now to get started just run `virtualenv venv` to create a virtual environment

> all of this should be done in your `root` directory of project

> this environment can also be used in your other projects but it is `NOT` recommended!

> to update pip version just use `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
